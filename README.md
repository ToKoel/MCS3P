Atomistic Monte Carlo simulation

![](./MCsim_structures.png)
*Simulated spin structures for particles of different sizes with an APB through the particle center. A field of \SI{5}{\tesla} is applied along the $x$-direction. Full parallel and antiparallel alignment of spins are indicated with red and blue arrows, respectively. Clearly visible is the ferrimagnetic order that is disturbed by the APB as can be seen by the change of the colors. A close-up of the spin structure at the APB for the largest particle is shown in fig.~\ref{fig: D11 local spin structure}.*
